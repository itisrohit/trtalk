# Chasqui — Architecture

> **Status:** design draft. **Codename:** `Chasqui` — after the relay messengers of the Inca empire, who carried messages across the network. A fitting metaphor for a messaging-agent gateway.

## 1. What Chasqui is

Chasqui is a **base development stack** for building custom AI agents on WhatsApp. You generate a project from it (one project per company), and you get a working conversational agent out of the box — single conversation thread per contact, long-term memory, an FAQ knowledge base with RAG, an admin panel with editable prompts, and a **tool/module system** where you build the differentiating logic for that specific company.

**The philosophy is omakase** — in the Rails sense ([*Rails is omakase*](https://dhh.dk/2012/rails-is-omakase.html), [*The Rails Doctrine*](https://rubyonrails.org/doctrine)): a curated, opinionated menu chosen by someone with skin in the game, instead of a buffet of abstractions. You can substitute dishes (the LLM and embeddings are `.env` swaps), but the menu has an owner: Postgres + pgvector is the stack's identity (ADR-002), conventions beat configuration, and the energy goes into your agent's differentiating logic — not into re-deciding plumbing. Common things (prompts, FAQs, enabling tools) are **configurable from the admin panel**; genuinely new logic is **code** you add through the tool system.

It ships with a project generator (**`uvx chasqui new`**, the [`cli`](https://github.com/chasqui-stack/cli) repo) that scaffolds a personalized, configured project — LLM, embeddings/dims, database location, WhatsApp credentials — ready to run locally and deploy. A `chasqui generate module` subcommand scaffolds new tool modules, `rails generate`-style.

## 2. Design principles

1. **Proven, low-surprise topology.** Gateway → Core → Admin. Three deployables — the minimum that the runtime constraints allow. "Boring" here is a virtue (see *Choose Boring Technology*): well-understood components, predictable failure modes, low operational surprise. No speculative services.
2. **Channel-pluggable.** The gateway is an *adapter*. WhatsApp (PyWa) and Telegram (python-telegram-bot) are live channels speaking the same contract; web widget and Instagram are future adapters that never touch the core.
3. **Tool-pluggable.** Agent tools are each company's differentiator. A clean **Tool Registry** lets you add them as self-contained modules without modifying the core.
4. **Config vs. code.** Frequently-changing things (prompts, FAQs, toggling tools) are editable from the admin with no redeploy. New behavior is code you add via the tool system.
5. **The core is the heart.** FastAPI + LangGraph + Postgres. All business logic lives here. Logic is never scattered across services.

## 3. Service topology

### 3.1 Gateway (PyWa) — channel adapter

- **Single responsibility:** translate between WhatsApp and the core's canonical contract. Receive webhooks, normalize (text, audio, image, buttons), POST to the core, then render the core's response back to the channel.
- **Stateless.** No database, no business logic. If it restarts, no state is lost.
- **Fast.** Meta enforces a webhook timeout → the gateway acks `200` immediately and processes against the core asynchronously.
- **PyWa 4.x (beta, BSUID-first)** — see §10 for the BSUID identity change.
- Adding a channel = a new adapter that produces/consumes the **same canonical message**.

### 3.2 Core Backend (FastAPI + LangGraph) — the heart

- All logic: models, tables, services, orchestrator, tools, memory, RAG, admin auth.
- A single PostgreSQL connection, with `pgvector` for RAG embeddings.
- Exposes:
  - `POST /ingest` — canonical entry point from any gateway.
  - REST API for the admin (JWT).
- Structure: `core / models / schemas / controllers / services` + a `modules/` package for tool modules.

### 3.3 Admin Panel (React + Vite SPA)

- React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, **Tailwind CSS** + **shadcn/ui**.
- Talks **directly** to the core over REST. No BFF.
- Visual language follows [`docs/design/DESIGN.md`](./design/DESIGN.md) (a Sentry-inspired token set: deep violet-midnight canvas, electric-lime accent, Rubik for UI / Monaco for code). The `DESIGN.md` format follows the [google-labs-code/design.md](https://github.com/google-labs-code/design.md) methodology — point your coding agent at it before writing UI.

## 4. Authentication model

Deliberately minimal:

- **Only admins authenticate.** The admin panel is for operators. JWT-based admin auth with a small number of admin accounts is enough — no organizations, no member roles, no self-serve signup.
- **End users never log in.** WhatsApp contacts are just `contacts` (§6). They never reach the admin panel and have no credentials. Identity comes from the channel (their BSUID), not from an auth system.

## 5. Canonical message contract (gateway ↔ core)

The seam that makes the system multi-channel. The core never knows WhatsApp exists — it only speaks this contract, so a future web channel is "just another adapter."

```jsonc
// Inbound: gateway → core  POST /ingest
{
  "channel": "whatsapp",            // "whatsapp" | "web" | "telegram" | ...
  "contact": {
    "external_id": "<bsuid>",       // BSUID for WhatsApp (see §10), channel-scoped id otherwise
    "wa_id": "51999888777",         // optional, may be null under BSUID
    "display_name": "Juan Pérez",
    "metadata": {}
  },
  "message": {
    "type": "text",                 // text | audio | image | button | ...
    "text": "Do you have a store in Miraflores?",
    "media_url": null,
    "raw": {}                       // original channel payload if needed
  },
  "received_at": "<iso8601>"
}
```

```jsonc
// Outbound: core → gateway (agent reply; may be 1..N messages)
{
  "messages": [
    { "type": "text", "text": "Yes, at Av. Larco 123. Want the hours?" }
    // { "type": "buttons", ... }, { "type": "image", ... }
  ],
  "conversation_id": "<uuid>"
}
```

An **empty `messages` list is silence** — that's how human-mode conversations
(§5.1) go quiet on every channel with zero gateway changes. It is **also** the
ack of the deferred-dispatch mode (§5.2): the agent reply arrives moments later
via `POST /send`, not in this response.

**`message.text` is standard Markdown, both directions.** The core emits one
canonical markup; each gateway renders it to its platform (Telegram →
MarkdownV2, WhatsApp → `*bold*`/`_italic_`, web widget → DOM nodes) —
formatting is presentation, so it lives in the adapter, exactly like media
transcoding. The core never formats for a channel
([ADR-007](./design/adr-007-canonical-markdown-rendering.md)).

The **canonical dialect** is this Markdown subset — what the agent may emit
and every gateway (including third-party channels built with the
`chasqui-create-channel` skill) MUST render:

| Construct | Canonical form |
|-----------|----------------|
| Bold | `**text**` |
| Italic | `*text*` or `_text_` |
| Strikethrough | `~~text~~` |
| Inline code / fenced block | `` `code` `` / ` ``` ` |
| Flat bullet list | `- item` (one level) |
| Link | `[label](url)` or a bare URL |

Headings (`#`), tables, nested lists, images-in-Markdown and HTML are **out of
the dialect** — chat bubbles have nowhere to put them. Gateways degrade
anything outside the subset gracefully rather than showing raw markup (e.g.
headings render as bold), but prompts must not rely on that. Note the
WhatsApp-syntax corollary: a persona prompt that asks for "WhatsApp
formatting" makes the agent emit `*bold*`, which is canonical *italic* — ask
for light standard Markdown instead and let the gateways transpose.

### 5.1 Canonical outbound contract — `POST /send` (ADR-004)

The mirror of `/ingest`, for **admin-initiated** messages (the human-handoff
inbox). Every gateway exposes it with the same `INTERNAL_API_KEY`; the core
resolves the URL per channel from `.env` (`CHANNEL_WHATSAPP_SEND_URL` — one
var per channel, zero core code for a new one):

```jsonc
// core → gateway  POST /send
{
  "contact": { "channel": "whatsapp", "external_id": "<bsuid>", "wa_id": "51999888777" },
  "message": {
    "type": "text",                  // text | image | document | audio
    "text": "Hi, this is Ana from the team…",   // body, or caption for image/document
    "media_url": null,               // base64 data: URI for media — the MIRROR of inbound
    "filename": null                 // documents: what the channel shows the user
  }
}
// 200 → { "status": "sent", "message_id": "<channel id>" }
// errors → { "detail": { "code": "NO_WA_ID" | "WINDOW_EXPIRED" | "SEND_FAILED" | "UNSUPPORTED_TYPE" | "INVALID_MEDIA", "message": "…" } }
```

Error `code`s flow through to the admin panel (e.g. WhatsApp's 24h
customer-service window → `WINDOW_EXPIRED`). Conversation ownership lives in
`conversations.mode` (`"agent" | "human"`): the ingest pipeline checks it
FIRST and runs no agent turn in human mode. Full rationale:
`docs/design/adr-004-conversation-mode-outbound-send.md`.

### 5.2 Inbound coalescing & deferred dispatch (ADR-008)

People fragment a thought across several quick sends. To answer the **whole
burst once** (coherent, 1 turn not N), the core can **debounce** inbound: when
`INBOUND_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS > 0` (default 5), `/ingest` persists the message,
arms a per-conversation silence window, and returns the **empty ack** above —
**no turn runs inline**. A Postgres-backed worker (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`,
multi-replica safe — no broker, ADR-002) claims conversations whose window has
elapsed, runs **one** turn over the batch, and **dispatches the reply via the
`/send` seam (§5.1)** — the reply path flips from synchronous to deferred over
the seam that already exists.

This makes `CHANNEL_<CH>_SEND_URL` a **prerequisite** for every active channel
when debounce > 0. Setting `INBOUND_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS = 0` restores the legacy
**synchronous** reply (in the `/ingest` body, no worker). Etapa 1 (a per-identity
advisory lock) serializes turns and is held in both paths. Full rationale:
`docs/design/adr-008-deferred-dispatch-coalescing.md`.

### 5.3 Audio handling: native → STT → graceful (ADR-010)

An inbound voice note (`type: "audio"`) is resolved in three tiers, by the
configured LLM's capabilities (`app/core/llm_capabilities.py`):

1. **Native audio** (`caps.audio = True`, e.g. Gemini) — the audio rides into
   the turn as a content block; the model hears it directly.
2. **STT fallback** (`caps.audio = False` **and** `STT_PROVIDER` set) — the core
   transcribes the audio to text **before** the turn (`app/services/transcription.py`),
   so an audio-less LLM (Anthropic, plain OpenAI GPT, …) can still answer. The
   transcriber is an **OpenAI-compatible** client (Groq `whisper-large-v3-turbo`
   by default — native OGG/Opus, no transcoding); its key (`STT_API_KEY`) is
   **separate** from the LLM's, since the LLM provider is deliberately not the
   audio one. Opt-in and best-effort: any failure falls through to tier 3.
3. **Graceful degradation** (no native audio, STT off/failed) — the agent is
   told it received a voice note it can't hear and asks the user to type it.

Full rationale: `docs/design/adr-010-stt-audio-fallback.md`.

### 5.4 Internal conversation read — rehydration (ADR-011)

The core exposes **one** gateway-facing read (everything else is admin/JWT):

```
GET /conversations/{channel}/{external_id}/messages   (INTERNAL_API_KEY)
```

the **read-mirror of `/ingest`**. It is **generic** (channel is a path param, no
per-channel branching) and **read-only** (404 on an absent contact — never
creates), returning a thread's recent messages newest-first with the admin
serialization (`has_media` boolean, **never** embeddings or media payloads). The
web channel uses it to rehydrate a visitor's chat on (re)open — including replies
delivered while the tab was closed; any channel can. Full rationale:
`docs/design/adr-011-web-channel.md`.

## 6. Core domain model

- **`contacts`** — the person on the other side. Unique by `(channel, external_id)`, where `external_id` is the **BSUID** for WhatsApp. `wa_id` is stored when available but is no longer the primary key (§10).
- **`conversations`** — a **single thread per contact**. `mode` (`"agent" | "human"`, indexed) says who owns the replies (ADR-004); orchestrator state lives in `conversation_state`; `debounce_due_at` is the inbound-coalescing window the worker claims (ADR-008).
- **`messages`** — full inbound/outbound history with type + metadata. This is the LLM context. `processed_at` marks an inbound as folded into a turn (NULL = pending for the coalesce worker, ADR-008).
- **`memories`** — long-term memory extraction so the agent doesn't forget the past (summaries, facts about the contact). A memory retriever injects what's relevant into the prompt. Backed by `pgvector`.
- **Orchestrator (LangGraph):** a configurable state machine. The base ships a minimal graph (router → tools → respond); each project extends it.

## 7. What the base ships vs. what you build

### In the base
- Admin authentication (admins only).
- Single conversation thread per contact + message history + long-term memory.
- **FAQ knowledge base with RAG** (mini-RAG over `pgvector`): admins load FAQs/documents, they're embedded, and a retriever tool answers from them. This is a common need, so it's built in.
- **Editable prompts** from the admin (system prompt, persona, rules).
- **Tool Registry** + a couple of generic example tools (e.g. `faq_search`, a lead-capture / human-handoff tool).
- WhatsApp gateway (PyWa) wired up.
- Admin panel: prompts, FAQ-RAG, tool enable/config, conversation inspection.
- Project generator + Kamal deploy config + docker-compose for collaborators.

### What you build per company (the differentiator)
- **Custom tools** via the Tool Registry (§8).
- Reference example — a **"Commercial Locations"** module (a CRUD of stores in the admin + a retriever tool the agent can call). Not in the base; it lives in the docs as a reference template for the *"customer-defined collection + auto-generated retriever"* pattern, which generalizes to product catalogs, branches, hours, pricing, policies.
- Particular integrations (CRMs, scheduling, the client's own APIs).
- Adjustments to the orchestrator graph.

## 8. Tool Registry — the differentiating piece

Tools are what make each agent unique. Chasqui builds on LangChain/LangGraph's native tool model rather than inventing its own.

### 8.1 How a tool is defined (LangChain native)

Simple tools use the `@tool` decorator; complex inputs use a Pydantic `args_schema`. Type hints define the input schema and the docstring becomes the description the model reads.

```python
from langchain.tools import tool, ToolRuntime
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field

class StoreLookupInput(BaseModel):
    city: str = Field(description="City to search stores in")

@tool(args_schema=StoreLookupInput)
def store_lookup(city: str, runtime: ToolRuntime) -> str:
    """Look up commercial locations in a given city."""
    tenant_cfg = runtime.context           # immutable per-project config
    # ...query DB, return human-readable text or structured data
    return "Av. Larco 123, Miraflores — open 9am-9pm"
```

Key LangChain mechanics Chasqui relies on:
- **`@tool` / `StructuredTool.from_function`** to declare tools; `args_schema` (Pydantic) for validated, typed inputs.
- **`ToolRuntime`** (injected, not part of the schema) for access to graph `state`, immutable `context` (per-project config), persistent `store` (`BaseStore` long-term memory), and `tool_call_id`. Reserved param names: `runtime`, `config`.
- **`bind_tools([...])`** to expose the active tool set to the model.
- **`ToolNode`** (`langgraph.prebuilt`) to execute tool calls inside the LangGraph orchestrator.
- A tool may return a **`Command`** (`langgraph.types`) to update graph state alongside a `ToolMessage`.
- **Error handling / dynamic tool filtering** via agent middleware (`wrap_tool_call`, `wrap_model_call`) — e.g. enable/disable tools per project at runtime.

### 8.2 The Chasqui module contract

A **module** wraps one or more tools plus the things they need (tables, admin endpoints). The core discovers registered modules at startup and feeds their tools to the orchestrator. Adding behavior = adding a module; the core stays untouched.

```python
# Sketch of a tool module
class ToolModule(Protocol):
    name: str
    def register_tools(self) -> list[BaseTool]: ...        # the LangChain tools
    def register_models(self) -> list[type]: ...           # optional: SQLModel tables + Alembic
    def register_admin_routes(self, router) -> None: ...    # optional: admin CRUD/config UI backing
    def config_schema(self) -> type[BaseModel] | None: ...  # optional: per-project settings
```

Each module is self-contained: its tool schema, its optional tables/migrations, its optional admin UI, and its enable/config state per project. This is the open-source extension point — contributors add capabilities as modules.

### 8.3 The reusable archetype

The "Commercial Locations" example is really an archetype: *"customer-defined collection + auto-generated retriever tool."* The same shape covers most "custom tool" requests (catalogs, branches, hours, pricing, policies). A semi-generic version of this module — admin defines a schema, fills data, a retriever tool is auto-exposed — is on the roadmap so this turns into configuration instead of code for the common case.

## 9. Repository strategy

Everything lives under the GitHub organization **`chasqui-stack`**. Because the org namespace already says "chasqui", repos drop the prefix and stay clean (`chasqui-stack/core` rather than `chasqui-stack/chasqui-core`).

A parent repo holds the orchestration; each service is a **git submodule** pointing at its own repository, for independent deployment.

```
chasqui-stack/chasqui          # parent repo (orchestration, docs, generator)
├── core/      → chasqui-stack/core       (submodule: FastAPI backend)
├── admin/     → chasqui-stack/admin      (submodule: React/Vite admin)

| Repo | Role |
|------|------|
| `chasqui-stack/chasqui` | Parent: docs, generator, compose, submodules |
| `chasqui-stack/core` | FastAPI + LangGraph backend |
| `chasqui-stack/admin` | React/Vite admin panel |
| `chasqui-stack/whatsapp` | PyWa gateway (WhatsApp channel) |
| `chasqui-stack/telegram` | python-telegram-bot gateway (Telegram channel) |

Channel adapters are their own repos under the same org, each consuming the canonical message contract. `chasqui-stack/telegram` is the second one (live); `chasqui-stack/web` and others follow the same shape.

## 10. Tech stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|------------|
| Gateway | Python, **PyWa 4.x (beta, BSUID-first)**, FastAPI, httpx, Sentry |
| Core | FastAPI, SQLModel, PostgreSQL + pgvector, Alembic, JWT, LangChain, LangGraph |
| Admin | React 19, TypeScript, Vite, TanStack Query, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui |
| LLM | Configurable via LangChain (Gemini / Claude / etc.) |
| Package mgrs | `uv` (core/gateway), `npm` (admin) |
| Infra | Docker, docker-compose (collaborators), **Kamal 2** (deploy, part of the stack), Sentry |

### WhatsApp identity: BSUID

WhatsApp is moving to **Business-Scoped User IDs (BSUID)**, a breaking change that replaces phone-number-based `wa_id` as the primary user identifier. PyWa 4.x is BSUID-first:

- `User.bsuid` is the **primary identifier**; `User.wa_id` becomes **optional** (may be `None`).
- New `User` fields: `bsuid`, `username`, `parent_bsuid`, `country_code`.
- Default `WhatsApp(user_identifier_priority="bsuid -> wa_id")`; replies/blocks use BSUID internally.
- Install beta: `uv add "pywa --prerelease=allow"` (or `pip install -U pywa --pre`).

**Design implication:** `contacts.external_id` stores the **BSUID**, not `wa_id`. `wa_id` is kept as an optional secondary attribute. This is baked into the canonical contract (§5) and domain model (§6) from day one to avoid a painful migration later.

## 11. Local development & deployment

**Local dev (native, primary).** PostgreSQL, Python (`uv`) and Node (`npm`) run directly on the developer machine — no containers required for day-to-day work.

```bash
# core
cd core && uv sync && make migrate && make dev
# gateway
cd whatsapp && uv sync && make dev
# admin
cd admin && npm install && npm run dev
```

**docker-compose** is provided as a one-command spin-up for collaborators who prefer not to install the toolchain locally.

**Deployment — Kamal 2** is part of the stack. Each service has `config/deploy.yml` + `.kamal/secrets`, proxied by hostname with auto-TLS.

| Service | Subdomain (example) | Port |
|---------|---------------------|------|
| Core    | `api.<domain>`      | 8090 |
| Gateway | `wsp.<domain>`      | 8000 |
| Admin   | `admin.<domain>`    | 3000 |

## 12. Roadmap (post v1)

- **Web channel (embeddable widget)** — anonymous visitors, live outbound over **SSE**, a Preact widget served by a Node gateway (`chasqui-stack/web`). **MVP in progress** (ADR-011, epic #23) — deliberately *not* SSR and *not* logged-in; chunked/token streaming is a gateway-local follow-up.
- Semi-generic **"customer-defined collection + retriever"** module.
- Additional channel adapters (Instagram, …). *(Telegram shipped in v0.2.0, ADR-006.)*
- Broker-backed workers / queues (`arq` / Celery) only if the Postgres-backed worker outgrows the DB — Postgres is the queue today (ADR-002, ADR-008's deferred-dispatch worker).
