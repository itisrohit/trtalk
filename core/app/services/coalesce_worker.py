"""Inbound coalesce worker (ADR-008) — the deferred half of core#6 Etapa 2.

When INBOUND_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS > 0, /ingest stops replying inline: it persists
the inbound as pending and arms `conversations.debounce_due_at`. This worker
claims conversations whose silence window has elapsed, folds the whole pending
burst into ONE agent turn, persists the reply, and dispatches it through the
canonical send seam (ADR-004) — the same `/send` the human-handoff outbound
already uses, so gateways need no new contract.

Concurrency model:
- One claim+turn per conversation runs in a SINGLE transaction that locks the
  conversation row with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`. Holding the lock across the
  turn keeps it simple and correct under N replicas (others skip the locked
  row); at TrTalk's scale a per-conversation row lock for a few seconds is
  fine. The per-identity advisory lock (Etapa 1) is also taken, serializing
  against a late straggler hitting /ingest mid-turn.
- Dispatch happens AFTER commit, best-effort (the notify_service posture): a
  gateway failure is logged, never rolls back the already-persisted turn.

The session factory is injectable so tests can bind the worker to their
transactional-rollback connection; production uses the real pooled factory.
