# TrTalk Core

FastAPI + LangGraph backend — the heart of [TrTalk](https://github.com/itisrohit/trtalk), the open-source stack for building custom AI chat agents (WhatsApp first; more channels on the roadmap).

Handles the canonical `/ingest` entry point, the agent orchestrator (LangGraph), conversation memory, FAQ-RAG (pgvector), the pluggable **tool registry**, and admin authentication.

## Stack

FastAPI · SQLModel · PostgreSQL + pgvector · Alembic · JWT · LangChain · LangGraph · `uv`.

## Local dev

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # configure DB + JWT + LLM key
uv sync
make migrate
make dev                 # http://localhost:8090  (/docs) — port via PORT in .env
```

## The agent

`POST /ingest` runs a real LangGraph turn (LangChain v1 `create_agent`):
DB-editable system prompt (`agent_config`, editable in the admin panel) + conversation
history + long-term memories (pgvector) + the current message — multimodal
(image/audio content blocks) when the configured model supports it.

**Swappable LLM** — a `.env` change, never code (`app/core/llm.py`):

```bash
LLM_PROVIDER=google     LLM_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash      # default (multimodal)
LLM_PROVIDER=anthropic  LLM_MODEL=claude-sonnet-4-6
LLM_PROVIDER=openai     LLM_MODEL=gpt-5-mini
LLM_PROVIDER=openrouter LLM_MODEL=vendor/model
LLM_PROVIDER=ollama     LLM_MODEL=llama3.3              # local, no key
```

Per-model vision/audio support is auto-detected (`app/core/llm_capabilities.py`);
unknown models degrade to text-only with a warning (override with
`LLM_SUPPORTS_VISION` / `LLM_SUPPORTS_AUDIO`).

**Voice notes on an audio-less LLM** (ADR-010): set `STT_PROVIDER` (default Groq
`whisper-large-v3-turbo` — native OGG/Opus, cheapest) + a separate `STT_API_KEY`
and inbound audio is transcribed to text before the turn. Unset = the agent asks
the user to type it. Native-audio models (Gemini) ignore STT and hear directly.

**Embeddings are swappable too** (`app/core/embeddings.py`, via
`init_embeddings()`): `EMBEDDING_PROVIDER` google/openai/ollama. The vector
width is **`EMBEDDING_DIM` (default 768) — provision-time config**: it's
baked into the schema on the first migrate; changing it (or the provider)
later means a column migration + re-embedding. ANN indexes are
**auto-selected from the dim** (`app/core/vector_search.py`): ≤2000 → HNSW
on `vector` · 2001–4000 → HNSW on a `halfvec` cast · >4000 → exact scan +
startup warning. Rationale: parent repo
`docs/design/adr-001-embeddings-provider-dims.md` (and ADR-002 for why
Postgres-only).

## Tool modules (the extension point)

Drop a self-contained package under `app/modules/` exposing a module-level
`module` attribute — it is discovered at startup and its tools reach the
agent **without touching core code**:

```python
# app/modules/my_feature/__init__.py
from langchain.tools import tool

@tool
def my_tool(query: str) -> str:
    """When and how the model should use it (the docstring is the manual)."""
    return "..."

class MyModule:
    name = "my_feature"
    def register_tools(self):
        return [my_tool]

module = MyModule()
```

Tools access the DB session / contact / conversation / config through
`runtime: ToolRuntime[TurnContext]` (`app/services/agent_context.py`).
Disable any tool at runtime via `agent_config.enabled_tools`
(`{"my_tool": false}`); tool exceptions become error `ToolMessage`s — the
graph never crashes.

Beyond tools, a module can contribute **its own tables**
(`register_models()` — `registry.discover()` runs in `alembic/env.py` and
the test conftest so they reach the metadata), **admin endpoints**
(`register_admin_routes()` — mounted JWT-protected under
`/admin/modules/<name>`) and **typed config knobs** (`config_schema()` →
stored in `agent_config.tool_config` under the module's `config_key`,
auto-rendered as a settings form in the admin panel). Keep config schemas
**flat** (str/int/float/bool fields only) — that's what the form renderer
understands.

Shipped examples: **`faq`** — the full-contract reference: Q&A knowledge
base with pgvector RAG (embed-on-save, threshold retrieval, honest miss),
admin CRUD + re-embed at `/admin/modules/faq/*`; **`handoff`** — human
handoff (flips the conversation to human mode + optional webhook/email
notification) and lead capture into a module-owned `leads` table with
operator-configurable required/extra fields; **`memory`** (silent fact
saving with dedup-on-save, plus `update_memory`/`forget_memory`
corrections).
Full walkthrough: parent repo `docs/design/module-example-commercial-locations.md`.

## Admin panel API

JWT-protected endpoints backing the [admin panel](https://github.com/itisrohit/admin)
(everything an operator changes takes effect on the agent's **next turn** — no redeploy):

- `GET/PUT /admin/config` — the `agent_config` singleton: system prompt,
  per-tool enable map (`enabled_tools`, missing key = enabled) and module
  settings (`tool_config`). Writes are validated against the registry: unknown
  tool names and schema-violating values are rejected with 422.
- `GET /admin/tools` — the tool registry: every module with its tools, enable
  state, `config_key` and JSON Schema (feeds the admin's auto-forms).
- `GET /admin/contacts` (+`/{id}`, `/{id}/messages`, `/{id}/memories`) —
  conversation inspection. Embeddings and media payloads are never
  serialized (messages carry a `has_media` boolean instead). The list grows
  inbox metadata (ADR-004): `mode`, handoff reason, `last_inbound_at`,
  a `?mode=human` filter and attention-first ordering.
- `PUT /admin/contacts/{id}/mode` — take over (`human`) / resume the bot
  (`agent`); `POST /admin/contacts/{id}/messages` — operator reply pushed
  through the channel gateway's `/send` (409 in agent mode; send-then-persist,
  gateway error codes like `WINDOW_EXPIRED` pass through). ADR-004.
- `GET /admin/modules/handoff/leads` — captured leads (module-contributed).
- `GET /admin/media/{message_id}` — short-lived presigned URL (as JSON) for a
  message's stored media; the panel feeds it to `<img>`/`<audio>`.
- `GET /admin/modules/faq/search?q=` — retrieval preview with similarity
  scores (module-contributed, like the rest of `/admin/modules/faq/*`).

## Human handoff & outbound (ADR-004)

`conversations.mode: "agent" | "human"` is checked **first** by `/ingest`:
in human mode the inbound is persisted, **no agent turn runs**, and the
canonical response is an empty `messages` list — silence on every channel,
zero gateway changes. The `human_handoff` tool flips the mode; the admin
flips it back.

Operator replies go out through the **canonical outbound seam**
(`app/services/channel_send.py`): each gateway exposes `POST /send` (the
mirror of `/ingest`, same `INTERNAL_API_KEY`) and the core resolves the URL
per channel from `.env` — `CHANNEL_WHATSAPP_SEND_URL`, one var per channel.
Text and media alike: image/document/audio travel as base64 `data:` URIs
(the mirror of the inbound contract) and are also stored in the bucket so
the admin timeline shows what the operator sent.

Handoffs can notify, both optional and best-effort (`app/services/notify_service.py`):
`NOTIFY_WEBHOOK_URL` (Slack/Zapier/n8n) and/or **SMTP email** via stdlib
`smtplib` — any relay works (Brevo, Mailgun, SES, Gmail app password):
`SMTP_HOST/PORT/USER/PASSWORD/FROM` + `NOTIFY_EMAIL_TO`.

## Inbound coalescing (ADR-008)

People fragment a thought across several quick messages. With
`INBOUND_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS > 0` (**default 5**), `/ingest` persists each inbound
and arms a per-conversation silence window instead of replying inline; after the
burst settles, a Postgres-backed worker (`FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, multi-replica
safe, no broker) folds the whole batch into **one** turn and dispatches the reply
through the outbound seam above (`app/services/coalesce_worker.py`).

So **`CHANNEL_<CH>_SEND_URL` is required per active channel** when debounce > 0 —
that's where the deferred reply goes (the core warns at startup if it's missing).
Set `INBOUND_DEBOUNCE_SECONDS=0` to keep the **legacy synchronous** reply in the
`/ingest` response (no worker). A per-identity advisory lock serializes turns in
both modes.

## Media storage (optional, ADR-003)

Inbound images/audio arrive as base64 `data:` URIs (canonical contract). With
storage configured, the core uploads each one to an **S3-compatible bucket**
(`boto3`) at persist time — key `media/<contact_id>/<message_id>.<ext>` stored
in `messages.media_url` — and serves it back to the admin via presigned URLs.
Four `.env` vars (`STORAGE_ENDPOINT_URL`, `STORAGE_BUCKET`,
`STORAGE_ACCESS_KEY`, `STORAGE_SECRET_KEY`) cover AWS S3, Cloudflare R2,
Spaces, B2 and the local dev bucket (the parent's `docker-compose` ships
RustFS with the bucket pre-created — dev/test only; production points at a
managed bucket). Unset = media is processed in-turn but not persisted —
degraded, not broken; upload failures never break the turn. The LLM context
stays text-only either way. See `app/core/storage.py` and
[`adr-003`](https://github.com/itisrohit/trtalk/blob/main/docs/design/adr-003-media-storage.md).

## Testing

```bash
make test                # = uv run pytest
```

DB-backed tests run against a dedicated **`<postgres_db>_test`** database (e.g. `trtalk_test`), **auto-created on first run** from the same connection settings as the app — your dev database is never touched. No extra setup: the only requirement is that your Postgres user can `CREATE DATABASE`.

Isolation follows the SQLAlchemy-recommended transactional-rollback pattern: each test runs inside an outer transaction (app `commit()`s become savepoints) that is rolled back at the end, so **nothing is ever written** to the test database and tests can't contaminate each other. See `tests/conftest.py`.

To point tests at another Postgres (e.g. CI), export `POSTGRES_HOST` / `POSTGRES_USER` / `POSTGRES_PASSWORD` / `POSTGRES_DB` — real env vars take priority over `.env`.

## Architecture

This service speaks only the **canonical message contract** — it never knows about WhatsApp. See the parent's [`docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`](https://github.com/itisrohit/trtalk/blob/main/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md) (§5 contract, §6 domain model, §8 tool registry, §10 BSUID).
